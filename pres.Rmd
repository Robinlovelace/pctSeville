# Context

- Work presented part of forthcoming paper (Marqués et al Under Review)

![](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/pctSeville/raw/master/figures/sev-cycle-paths.png)

---

# Current approach

- Focus on cycle paths around central area has a number of **negative** consequences (see below)

- Working hypothesis: these can be tackled by 'Bike `&` Ride' systems

# These include:

- Social inequalities: only (on average wealthy) parts of the population benefit
- Spatial inequalilities: rural and suburban areas tend to be neglected by cycling advocacy and policy ([Cooper and Leahy, 2017](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1080/17450101.2016.1254898))
- Cycling tends not to replace cars in the city centre, which has a number of knock-on impacts:
    - Dangerous levels of traffic
    - Air pollution
    - Congestion
    - Political support for driving

- Emphasis on wealthy centres can lead to political 'bikelashes'

# PT/cycling integration in context

- Public Transport and associated infrastructure have a range of impacts

# Data & Methods

---

Data input
==========

Needs origin-destination (OD) data, available from many places (in roughly descending order of quality):

-   Census of population (see the UK's [Wicid open data portal](http://wicid.ukdataservice.ac.uk/) for an example of this)
-   Travel survey data
-   Mobile telephone company data
-   Modelled data using a spatial interaction model

> - Each of these has advantages and disadvantages.

---

# Local input data

Two main data sources that can be used to model OD-level travel in Seville: official data on population counts.

- Official data described in [a short article on rpubs.com/robinlovelace](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/209274)
- Sample of this data available in the github repo [robinlovelace/pctSeville](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/pctSeville)
- OpenStreetMap (OSM) data used for station location and (potentially) for estimating travel, via:
     - A spatial interaction including trip generators and 'attractors'
     - Trip attractors: hospitals, schools, shops etc.
     - Trip generators: residential buildings
- But we use sample data to illustrate the methods
- Randomly generated points
- OSM data used because it is smaller and more generalisable

<!-- Randomly generated data -->
<!-- ----------------------- -->

<!-- Let's split that region into 100 evenly sized areas, and give each cell a random value between 1 and 100: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- raster::values(r) = runif(n = 100, min = 0, max = 100) -->
<!-- (m = qtm(region_poly) + -->
<!--   tm_shape(r) + tm_raster()) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ![](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/pctSeville/raw/master/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png) -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Converting residential zones to 'centroid' points -->


<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- o = as(r, "SpatialPointsDataFrame") -->
<!-- m + -->
<!--   qtm(o) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ![](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/pctSeville/raw/master/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png) -->

<!-- # Simulating (10) destinations  -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- region_centre = rgeos::gCentroid(region_poly) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ![](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/pctSeville/raw/master/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png) -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Estimating flow -->

<!-- We can estimate the 'flow' (T) between origins (`o`) and destinations (`d`) in many ways. The simplest is a simple gravity model, whereby, for each OD pair: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- T = \\frac{mn}{d^2} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!--  whereby m and n are some measure of size/attractiveness of `o` and `d` respectively. Implementing this in code, we can calculate all the flows as follows: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- T_od = matrix(nrow = nrow(o), ncol = nrow(d)) -->
<!-- for(i in 1:nrow(o)) { -->
<!--   for(j in 1:nrow(d)) { -->
<!--     T_od[i, j] = o$layer[i] * d$w[j] / geosphere::distHaversine(o[i,], d[j,]) -->
<!--   } -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Conversion into spatial lines -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- l = od2line(flow = T_odp, zones = o, destinations = d) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- On the map of Seville, and with width and opacity proportional to flow, this looks as follows: -->

<!-- Using real data -->
<!-- --------------- -->

# Creation of 'flowlines'

- Lines between residential origins and nearest station

![](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/pctSeville/raw/master/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

---

# Route allocation

These can be allocated to the transport network as follows:

``` r
routes = stplanr::line2route(l = l, route_fun = route_graphhopper, vehicle = "bike")
```

![](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/pctSeville/raw/master/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

---

# Route network generation

The final stage is to aggregate the values of overlapping lines:

``` r
rnet = overline(routes, "potential")
```

# Estimates of Bike & Ride potential

- Across Seville there is high potential for Bike & Ride
- This would boost cycling in suburban areas
- 13,000, 25,000 and 57,000 trips (short, medium and long term)
- Results also tell us where the potential is highest:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
readr::read_csv("data/results.csv") %>% 
  slice(c(1:3, 9)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Bike & Ride potential for selected stations (trips/day): long, medium and short term.", format = "html")

```

# Discussion

- How to operationalise this research?
- International scalability
- Citizen health, congestion and air pollution estimates possible

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Could it help mitigate 'bikelash' -->

<!-- - Often caused by perception that cycling investment is not for everyone -->
<!-- - Wealth people tend to live in city centres -->
<!-- - Baltimore: legal proceeding to protect cycle path (source: [citylab](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/07/baltimore-battles-its-bike-lanes/533424/)) -->
<!-- - Seattle: "war on cars" meme overcome by 'smart language' -->
<!-- - Waltham Forest, London: bikelash against 'mini Holland' scheme tackled by broadening appeal of cycling advocacy groups -->
